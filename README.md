<h1>Project Vision and Intro</h1>

A mobile-first, responsive WordPress starter theme for churches.

Steeple was built from the Bones WordPress starter theme by Eddie Machado. Bones was built to make the life of the developer easier using HTML5 and a strong semantic foundation.

Steeple turns Bones into the perfect Starter theme for a church website. It adds a custom front-page with a full-width slider, a custom "sermon" content-type, and is ready to integrate with events calendars and social network profiles.

Steeple is built for developers. It provides a fully-funcitonal starting point, but with very limited styling and the flexibility to customize it even more. Use it to build the perfect theme for your church website.

<h2>Current Status</h2>

Steeple is currently in alpha stage development.

The Bones starter theme and the Church Theme Framework repositories have been copied in as submodules in the directories "marrow" and "churchthemesframework," respectively. Files to be included in final Steeple project should be moved into the main project directory after they have been edited and approved.

Submodules contain redundant files, these should be combined/edited and reduced to a single file in the main directory.

Bones starter theme currently supports .scss. For intitial and/or beta development, Steeple will not support any CSS compiler, though we hope to add that in an early release.

Bones submodules is built with a responsive CSS grid. Should be evaluated and decide if should be kept or if should be replaced with a bootstrap grid.

Church Theme Framework contains many components that we will want want to include. These can be used to replace elements of Bones theme as desired.
