<h1>Project Vision and Intro</h1>

A mobile-first, responsive WordPress starter theme for custom church websites.

Steeple was built from the Bones WordPress starter theme by Eddie Machado. Bones was built to make the life of the developer easier using the HTML 5 Boilerplate. 

Steeple adds functionality to Bones that enables more rapid development for church websites. 

Like Bones, Steeple is built for developers. It provides a fully-funcitonal starting point, but it's meant to be modified and customized. Use it to build the perfect theme for your church website.

The Bones starter grid needs to be evaluated and updated to support a wider range of media querries.

<h2>Use and Implementation</h2>

<h3>To use the Meta-Slider plugin on the front-page:</h3>

First, install and activate the meta-slider plugin.

Second, create a slider.

Third, edit the "header.php" template file: replace "metaslider id=123" on line 79 with the proper ID of your slider.

<h3>To Use Featured Content on Front Page</h3>

This functionality is taken straight from the Twenty Fourteen Wordpress Default Theme:

Designate a tag to be used as the "featured" tag in the Admin panel.

Tag posts with the Featured tag.

Change settings to point to a static page as front-page.

Featured posts will now appear in featured content area of the front-page.
