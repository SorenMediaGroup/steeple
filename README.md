<h1>Project Vision and Intro</h1>

A mobile-first, responsive WordPress starter theme for churches.

Steeple was built from the Bones WordPress starter theme by Eddie Machado. Bones was built to make the life of the developer easier using HTML5 and a strong semantic foundation. It includes a responsive CSS grid and SASS stylesheets.

Steeple turns Bones into the perfect Starter theme for a church website. It adds a custom front-page with a full-width slider, custom content types, and ready integration with events calendars and social network profiles to give a major head-start to church theme designers.

Steeple is built for developers. It provides a fully-funcitonal starting point, but it's meant to be modified and customized. Use it to build the perfect theme for your church website.

<h2>Current Status</h2>

Steeple is currently in alpha stage development. Feel free to jump in and contribute to making it a working reality!

The Bones starter theme has been updated: "bones" replaced with "steeple" in most theme files. (Exceptions: url's for Bones theme have been left intact; translation files have not been updated.)

Starter theme files need to be screened and modified to meet design goals for a starter church theme.

Bones starter theme supports translation into numerous languages. That isn't a top priority, but we'll add it into later updates.

Bones submodule is built with a responsive CSS grid. Should be evaluated and decide if should be kept or if should be replaced with a bootstrap grid.
