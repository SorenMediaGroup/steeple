steeple
=======

A mobile-first, responsive WordPress starter theme for churches.

Steeple was built from the Bones WordPress starter theme by Eddie Machado. Bones was built to make the life of the developer easier using HTML5 and a strong semantic foundation.

Steeple turns Bones into the perfect Starter theme for a church website. It adds a custom front-page with a full-width slider, a custom "sermon" content-type, and is ready to integrate with events calendars and social network profiles.

Steeple is built for developers. It provides a fully-funcitonal starting point, but with very limited styling and the flexibility to customize it even more. Use it to build the perfect theme for your church website.
